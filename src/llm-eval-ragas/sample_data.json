        "question": "How do neural networks work?",
        "answer": "Neural networks work by processing information through interconnected layers of nodes called neurons. Each connection has a weight that adjusts during training to minimize prediction errors.",
        "contexts": ["Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information. The network learns by adjusting connection weights based on training data."],
        "ground_truth": "Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes or neurons that process and transform input data through weighted connections, learning patterns through backpropagation."
