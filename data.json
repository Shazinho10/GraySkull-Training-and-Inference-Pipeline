The BCB remains committed to safeguarding the well-being of its players, officials and staff while engaging constructively with the ICC to address the matter.”\nThe T20 World Cup is being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8. Bangladesh are scheduled to play three T20 World Cup group matches in Kolkata and one in Mumbai.\nBangladesh requested that the ICC shift its World Cup venue from India after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) instructed the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to remove Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from its squad for this year’s tournament.\nThe BCCI did not give any specific reason for the removal of the star left-arm paceman from the IPL, but it is believed it was done because of the recent political tensions between the two countries.\nEarlier this month, Bangladesh banned broadcasts of the IPL, with its Ministry of Information and Broadcasting saying that the decision was taken “in public interest” as the BCCI’s move “caused distress among the people of Bangladesh”.",
